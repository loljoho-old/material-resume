# Paper Résumé

Front-End Web Developer résumé application by Jonathan Ho

## Overview

> In an effort to showcase the skills of a Front-End Developer, I decided to create a simple AngularJS single-page application in lieu of/in addition to your typical curriculum vitae or résumé.  
> 
> While the application itself is simple in nature, the development process displays proficiency in a number of tools, concepts, and technologies such as: 
> 
> * AngularJS and third-party modules
> * Git and GitHub 
> * Gulp task automation
> * E2E and Unit Testing
> * Semantic Versioning
> * Overall understanding of the software release life cycle
> 
> Additionally, the rapid production of this application, from its inception to its release, aims to showcase my current prowess as well as my potential when it comes to delivering viable real-world code.
>
> I hope this repository succeeds in what I set out to accomplish, i.e. further establishing my qualifications in the candidacy of a (Front-End) Web Developer position.
> 
> Yours Truly,
>

## Development

This project is an AngularJS single-page web application featuring featuring `ngAnimate`, `ngAria`, `ngMaterial`, `ngResource`, and the third-party `ui-router`.  

The [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator [generator-gulp-angular](https://github.com/Swiip/generator-gulp-angular) was used to quickly scaffold a full feature [Gulp](gulpjs.com)-based application development environment due to time constraints.


## Design

While taking into consideration the extremely short period of time in which this application was developed, a number of key design elements and concepts were prioritised above all else:

 * Implement a **Mobile-Friendly**, **Cross-Platform/Browser** user interface accomplished through **Responsive Web Design** and **Progressive Enhancement** over Graceful Degradation, ensuring a consistent user experience that supports all modern platforms and browsers--support of the latter being *N* And *N-1*.
